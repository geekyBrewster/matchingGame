# matchingGame
<h3>April 18, 2017</h3>
<p> Starting working on the smallest chunk for a flip the card and find the pairs style matching game. Using it as a project to further work with Javascript, DOM manipulation, etc. Stage 1: figure out how to build a single "card" - an element that switches from a solid color to an image and back again. So far so good. Next step: create two cards and figure out the comparision logic.</p>
